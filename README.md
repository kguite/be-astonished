Be Astonished is a full stack MERN app, using Node authorization.

The purpose of Be Astonished is to be a social-media free space to focus on the moments that matter. 

As a busy parent or student, it's easy to take to social media when you need those 15 minutes to unwind.  But what if you refocused that energy on noticing the miracles around you every day?  

What if you were intentional with that time and instead of Reddit, used it to focus on something miraculous (NASA or National Geographic photos of the day) or inspiring (Poetry of the day, music, curated podcasts)? 

Or instead scrolling Instagram and giving your data to Facebook, you upload a photo and write a little bit of something around you that is meaningful to you?

<em>Pay attention.</em> <br>
<em>Be astonished.</em> <br>
<em>Tell about it.</em> <br>
